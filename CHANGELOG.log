- Default sorting order (A-Z) for every module. Complete control on the sorting to come in future releases.
- Fix the name filter option on the instances page
- Now passing the ENVIRONMENT while provisioning a machine.
- Removing check for the filesystem. The vagrant-worker might (and actually should) be on another machine than the vagrant-control, so it makes sense for vagrant-control to _not_ be able to check if the path exists.

- Forcing user to login to use the app. Only G+ auth is supported for now, but
  vagrant-control uses flask-oauth and can be configured to use any provider
  (but no option from vagrant-control yet).
- Adding breadcrumb according UX team ideas
