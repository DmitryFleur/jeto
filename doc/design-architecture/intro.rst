Intro
=====

The main idea behind Jeto is to deploy full vagrant machines on all environments.
We had two main issues when we begun working on this :

* We could not have a global view of all the vagrant machines installed (global-status didn't exist at the time)
* Having more than one sysadmin meant having a dedicated machine for this.

We then decided to build *Vagrant-Control*, now known as *Jeto*.

The word 調eto comes from the esperanto language, which means *release*. `The esperanto language is a constructed language
that aims to be political free and unite all people <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto>`_.
We saw it fit to use a word in this language.

調eto tries as much as possible to follow the main Unix philosophy : `Do One Thing And It Well <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy>`_.
For this reason 調eto breaks into 4 main modules:

* 調eto : the web application providing the nice UI
* nginx-api : python (flask) RESTful application creating/editing nginx sites and reloading nginx.
* htpasswd-api : python (flask) RESTful application creating/editing HTTPDigest password lists.
* vagrant-worker : daemon that runs vagrant commands (up, provision, destroy, etc.) and save results to redis.
  Also takes care of all the file operation (git clone, unarchive package).
